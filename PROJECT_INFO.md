### Features Implemented

1. **Federal Taxes**
   - Regular income tax (progressive brackets)
   - Capital gains tax (0%, 15%, 20%)
   - Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT)
   - Net Investment Income Tax (NIIT - 3.8%)
   - Additional Medicare Tax (0.9%)

2. **California Taxes**
   - State income tax (1% to 12.3%)
   - Mental Health Services Tax (1% over $1M)
   - State Disability Insurance (SDI)

3. **Deductions**
   - Standard vs Itemized comparison
   - Medical expenses (7.5% AGI floor)
   - SALT deduction ($10,000 cap)
   - Mortgage interest
   - Charitable contributions (with AGI limits)
   - Donor-Advised Fund support

4. **Special Scenarios**
   - ISO exercise (AMT calculation)
   - Multiple income sources
   - Investment income
   - Rental income

## Quick Start

### 1. Activate the virtual environment:
```bash
cd /home/azhar/tax-calculator
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. For Jupyter Lab:
```bash
# Install Jupyter if not already installed
pip install jupyter pandas matplotlib

# Launch Jupyter Lab
jupyter lab
```

Then open: `examples/tax_analysis_example.ipynb`

### 3. For Python scripts:
```bash
# Run the example
python examples/simple_example.py

# Or create your own script
python your_tax_script.py
```

## Example Usage

```python
from taxcalc import (
    FilingStatus,
    TaxpayerInfo,
    IncomeData,
    ItemizedDeductions,
    TaxCalculator2024
)

# Define taxpayer
taxpayer = TaxpayerInfo(
    filing_status=FilingStatus.MARRIED_JOINT,
    age_primary=45,
    age_spouse=43
)

# Define income
income = IncomeData(
    wages_w2=400000,
    long_term_capital_gains=100000
)

# Define deductions
itemized = ItemizedDeductions(
    state_local_income_taxes=25000,
    mortgage_interest=35000,
    cash_contributions_50pct_orgs=40000
)

# Calculate
calc = TaxCalculator2024(taxpayer, income, itemized)
results = calc.calculate_all_taxes()

# View results
print(calc.generate_summary_report(results))
print(f"Total Tax: ${results.total_tax_liability:,.2f}")
print(f"Effective Rate: {results.effective_total_rate*100:.2f}%")
```

- Effective rate comparisons

## Important Notes

1. **Above-the-line deductions**: Subtract 401(k), IRA, HSA from wages before input
2. **Accuracy**: Based on official IRS and CA FTB 2024 guidance
3. **Limitations**: Does not include self-employment tax calculation
4. **Use**: For planning purposes only - consult tax professional for filing

## Package Installation

The package is installed in editable mode (`-e`), so you can modify the source code and changes will be immediately available without reinstalling.

To reinstall or update:
```bash
cd /home/azhar/tax-calculator
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

## Dependencies

Core package: **None** (uses only Python standard library)

Optional (for examples):
- jupyter
- pandas
- matplotlib

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Package is installed and tested
2. 📊 Open Jupyter Lab and explore the example notebook
3. 🧮 Create your own tax scenarios
4. 📈 Use visualizations to understand tax breakdown
5. 💡 Experiment with different income and deduction combinations

## Support & Documentation

- **Full Documentation**: See README.md
- **Quick Start**: See QUICKSTART.md
- **Examples**: Check examples/ directory
- **Code**: Well-documented source in taxcalc/

## Testing
